    style F fill:#e8f2d0,stroke:#9ed94a,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#f2d0e8,stroke:#d94a9e,stroke-width:2px
```

### Resume Analysis

The app leverages OpenAI's advanced language models to analyze your resume and provide feedback in several key areas:

1. **Overall Assessment**: General impression and high-level recommendations
2. **Section Analysis**: Specific feedback for each section (experience, education, skills, etc.)
3. **Improvement Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations to enhance your resume
4. **Numerical Score**: A score out of 100 to help track improvements over time

### API Integration

The application uses the OpenAI API with a structured prompt to ensure consistent, high-quality feedback:

```typescript
// Simplified example from src/utils/openaiUtils.ts
const prompt = `You are a professional resume coach. Review the following resume and provide:
1. Overall impressions (3-5 sentences)
2. Section-by-section feedback with specific improvements for each section
3. 5 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement
4. A score out of 100

Format your response as valid JSON with the following structure:
{
  "overallImpression": "string with overall feedback",
  "sectionFeedback": {
    "section name": "feedback for this section",
    ...other sections
  },
  "suggestions": ["suggestion 1", "suggestion 2", ...],
  "score": number
}`;
```

## üîß Customization Options

You can customize various aspects of the application to fit your specific needs:

### AI Prompt Customization

Modify the AI prompt in `src/utils/openaiUtils.ts` to focus on specific aspects of resume analysis or change the tone/style of feedback:

```typescript
// Example modification to focus on ATS optimization
const prompt = `You are a professional resume coach specializing in ATS optimization. 
Review the following resume and provide:
1. Overall assessment of ATS compatibility (3-5 sentences)
2. Section-by-section feedback with specific keyword improvements
// ...rest of prompt
`;
```

### Visual Theme Customization

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Customize the theme by editing `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
// Example: Changing the primary color scheme
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      blue: {
        50: '#e6f0ff',
        100: '#bbd6ff',
        // ...your custom color palette
        600: '#2563eb', // primary button color
        700: '#1d4ed8',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Feedback Display Customization

Modify the display of feedback in `src/components/FeedbackCard.tsx` to change the layout, add new sections, or adjust the visualization of the score.
